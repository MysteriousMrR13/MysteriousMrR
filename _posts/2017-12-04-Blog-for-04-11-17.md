    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I didn't know how to code the mothership but after several cases of trial and error I did it.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked my friends if they could help me with one of the chunks of coding.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I added code that wasn’t necessary and improved my work in different ways.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>After coding two other sprites I could pick bits that were good and implement them in to this sprite.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to sir as he walked us through all the logic of the coding.</td>

    <td>If I’d included more reflecting that would be great as then I would know more about this.</td>
