  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Having already planned our games and what we wanted from them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To start coding our games how we want them to look like.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes - I have started to do the basic code and have made my sprites and some backdrops.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Yes - accidently got rid of one of my sprites that had all of my code on so I had to start again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Yes - I asked how scrolling backgrounds work so I could possibly add this to my game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Yes - of  course these are our games so WE have to code them how we like.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Yes - after have already done a part of Space invaders on Scratch I knew how I code use some of these skills in my project.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Yes - I listened carefully about how to do scrolling backgrounds.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Perhaps if I had spent more time on the code than the sprites and backdrops.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
