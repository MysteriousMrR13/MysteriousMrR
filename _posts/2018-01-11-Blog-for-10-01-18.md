  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Not much - as in this lesson we were mainly just disguising what makes a game good or bad and what ideas we could use for ours.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Yes - We asked a lot of questions to fully understand why different games stand out more than others.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Yes - We had to think by ourselves what would be a good fun game to make using scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Yes - As we have already played a lot of games we can use where they went wrong to help us.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Yes - I made sure I grasped everything being told in order to help me in the future.</td>

    <td>Perhaps if I had used my knowledge of games a bit more in order to help me code my game as I do play quite a fair amount of time.</td>
