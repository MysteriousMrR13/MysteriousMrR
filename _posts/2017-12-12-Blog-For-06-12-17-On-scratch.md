<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Knowing needed info. To code the aliens and able to use knowledge to guide us. Only yet coded the Spaceship, Bullet and mothership.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Coding the aliens to when hit the edge go down and move from side to side.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Partly yes - I don't think I fully reached it as the aliens are in odd numbers for each row they are supposed to be 9 per row.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Yes - I was always going wrong whilst finding different possibilities to make the rows equal, I got close but didn't really manage it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Yes - I struggled making the rows equal so I asked my dad whether he knew what was causing the problem he wasnâ€™t quite sure and thought maybe I needed another chunk of code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Yes - Towards the end we needed to implement code that we had to think of ourselves to finish off and make it better working.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Yes - There were mistakes I made previously like adding in unnecessary coding to the work that was running really well and as a result making it worse. I decided not to do this to that heavy extent. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Yes - we were given a document to help us and I read through it all to help me with my skills and work rather than just copying the pictures.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Perhaps if I had done more work in lesson that would have given me a larger amount of time to work on the chunks I struggled with.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Taking in more work quicker leaving me more time to finish if I needed to ask for help on the last part. </td>
