    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Able to describe different aspects of the games but not fully understanding them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To describe the Sprites and variables for 80s retro games (at least 5 games) and understand them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes. I managed to list the key sprites and variables.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Obviously this project required a lot of patience and perseverance as we would have to play the games a fair amount before hand and then write about them and keep on looking back and forth to them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>None used.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I had to rely on my own skills and common sense when writing about this and make sure that i was definitely putting in what was asked from me and more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I could use what I knew about these other retro 80s games to write about the knew ones.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had to concentrate whilst playing the games so I could list the features.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Use my initiative sometimes rather than going a long way to find the answer when i know what it is.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
